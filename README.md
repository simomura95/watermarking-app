On the upper part, the user can choose which kind of logo to add: a photo (clicking on the button and selecting it from the pc) or text (typing it).<br>
Then, with the button on the bottom, any number of photo can be selected for watermarking.

Only at this moment the "Confirm" button allows to proceed.
If both a logo and text are given for watermark, only the photo is used.

- WATERMARK WITH A LOGO (or any other image): it is added on the bottom right of each image. Transparent parts remain transparent.
- WATERMARK WITH TEXT: it is added in white color on the upper left of each photo.

In the end, the results are saved in a folder.
